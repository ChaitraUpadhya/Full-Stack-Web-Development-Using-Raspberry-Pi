Full stack development using Raspberry Pi uses Javascript, HTML as well as CSS. This IoT system takes input from the DHT11 sensor that measures the Humidity and Temperature and updates the values to the firebase webapp in the real time.
The firebase web app has a dashboard that displays the current temperature and humidity as well as a chart to visualise the same through  out the day.

The DHT sensor is connected to GPIO 4 on the Raspberry Pi.
